This project will explore different methods of using NLP on the data with the goal of finding a good way of organising papers past by topic.
We will visualise and report on the results and preprocess over time and by region to give a descriptive overview of P
papers past through the topics. We will also make recommendations about the best ways to present topic model results to users.
