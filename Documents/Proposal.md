# Description:

This project will explore different methods of using NLP on the data with the goal of finding a good way of organising Papers Past by topic.
We will visualise and report on the results over time and by region to give a descriptive overview of Papers Past through the topics. We will also make recommendations about the best ways to present topic model results to users, e.g., number of topics to show by using  models such as: 
* Topic Modeling 
* LDA  
* NMF
* Kmeans


# Data Description:
